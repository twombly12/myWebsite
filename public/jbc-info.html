                <h2 id="logo">Logo Info</h2>
                <h3 class="sub-heading dark-color-text">What will I receive with my Logo?</h3>
                <p>Please refer to the <a href="#project">Project Overview</a> at the top of this page</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading dark-color-text">How do I get started on my Logo?</h3>
                <p>You can begin the Logo Process by submitting the Intake Form that was provided in your introductory email</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading dark-color-text">Do I need to have my Business Name registered before I fill out the Logo Intake Form?</h3>
                <p>Yes, please ensure that your Business Name is registered before you begin the process for your Logo. Changing your Business Name partway through the Logo process will count as a round of revisions.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading dark-color-text">Are the questions on the Intake Form important?</h3>
                <p>Extremely! The more information that you provide in the Logo Intake Form, the better we can understand who you are, what your style is, and what type of logo might suit you. This makes it more likely that you will receive something that
                    resonates with you personally, and is something that you wil be excited about. We understand that you may not have the answers to all of the questions, but please try your best.</p>
                <p> In particular, give extra attention to these questions; </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> What is the Origin of your Business Name? </li>
                    <li>Who are your competitors, and what do you think of their Logos? </li>
                    <li>What Colors would you like to see in your Logo? </li>
                    <li> Please provide links to a few Logos that you Love.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="sub-heading dark-color-text">When do I have to submit my Logo Intake Form by?</h3>
                <p>You only have to submit your answers to the form once you are ready to begin. However, please let us know that you have received the Introduction Email with the Logo Form Intake link, so we know that it didn’t get lost in your Spam / Junk
                    folder.
                </p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading dark-color-text">What happens after I submit my Intake Form?</h3>
                <p>Once you have submitted your Intake Form, we will reach out to you within 1 Business Day to confirm receipt. At this point, we will have everything we need to begin your Logo, and we will get to work! We will have the initial draft of
                    Logo Concepts ready for you within 7 days</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading dark-color-text"> How many Logo Concepts will I receive? </h3>
                <p> The initial drafts for your Logo will contain 3-4 Logo Concepts for you to review </p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading dark-color-text"> Can I make changes to the Logo Concepts? </h3>
                <p> Once you have received the initial drafts for your Logo Concepts, you can request revisions and adjustments to the concepts </p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading dark-color-text"> How many revisions can I request? </h3>
                <p> You can request adjustments to 2-3 concepts per round of revision, and we can do up to 3 rounds of revisions </p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading dark-color-text">How do I send the request for my revisions?</h3>
                <p>All revision requests must be sent by email to your designer</p>
                <p>Providing reference material is incredibly beneficial for both parties! This is epecially true if you have specific colors or design styles that you would like to emulate</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading dark-color-text">Is there a phone number that I can call?</h3>
                <p>Unfortunately, phone calls cannot be accepted to discuss the Logo Concepts or revisions. Due to the visual nature of the work, everything must be provided via email. Text messages, Social Media Message, etc... cannot be accepted either.</p>

                    Logo Intake Form. The 500 printed Business Cards will be divided amongst the Operators.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading dark-color-text">When do you create my Business Cards & Letterhead?</h3>
                <p>Once your Logo is completed, we will re-confirm your Contact Info with you for your Business Cards and Letterhead.</p>
                <p>After your Contact Info is confirmed, we will create your Business Cards & Letterhead</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading dark-color-text">What if I want to use my Business Cards & Letterhead Files in Word? </h3>
                <p>Here are a few options for using your Business Cards & Letterhead Files in Word are; </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Export the PDF to a Word Document <a target="__BLANK" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/how-to/export-pdf-to-word-excel-ppt.html?set=acrobat--fundamentals--export-pdf">(Tutorial)</a></li>
                    <li>Convert your PDF to an Image, and add it as background to your Word Document <a target="__BLANK" href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/acrobat/pdf-to-image?x_api_client_id=adobe_com&x_api_client_location=pdf_to_image">(Tutorial)</a></li>
                    <li>Preprint your Letterhead, and load it into your paper tray (<a target="__BLANK" href="https://infoserve.lexmark.com/ids/ifc/ids_topic.aspx?root=v27596224&gid=v7483254&id=v7483253&topic=v21588554&productCode=Lexmark_CS417&loc=en_IN">Tutorial) </a></li>
                    <li>Open the PDF as a Word Document <a target="__BLANK" href="https://www.wikihow.com/Convert-a-PDF-to-a-Word-Document">(Tutorial) </a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some of these solutions may not work depending on your Operating System, or the version of Word that you are using (Word barely plays nicely with itself at the best of times). The best options are to convert the PDF to an image and use
                    it as a background, or to preprint your letterhead. </p>
